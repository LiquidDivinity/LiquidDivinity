- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LiquidDivinity
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning some new technologies but im a little lazy and feel kinda stretched out because i suddenly get urges to learn or do something
      but i cant or wont always commit to them. I hope by putting stuff up on github will help motivate me and help me make some progress.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning whatever i feel like. Currently interested in Web development and a little in programming. Doing IT studies.
